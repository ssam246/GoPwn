 Features:
- Automates queries to **Bing**
- Extracts **URLs, titles, and descriptions**
- Supports **pagination for deeper searches**
- Output results in **JSON, CSV, or plaintext**

 **Example Usage:**
`bing_scraper -query "site:example.com" -pages 5 -output results.json`

### **üåê DNS Tools**

#### **DNS Server**

A lightweight **DNS server** written in Golang, useful for handling and logging DNS queries.

Features:
- Handles **A, AAAA, CNAME, and TXT records**
- Supports **custom domain resolution**
- Logs **incoming queries** for analysis

**Example Usage:**
`dns_server -port 53 -config dns_config.json`

#### **DNS Proxy**

A **transparent DNS proxy** that can modify or redirect queries for security analysis and MITM attacks.

Features:
- Forward queries to **upstream DNS servers**
- Modify **responses on-the-fly**
- Supports **logging and debugging**

**Example Usage:**
`dns_proxy -upstream 8.8.8.8 -log dns.log`

#### **Subdomain Fuzzer**

A tool to **brute-force subdomains** using a wordlist.

Features:
- Supports **multithreading** for faster enumeration
- Can resolve **IP addresses** of found subdomains
- Export results in **CSV or JSON**

**Example Usage:**
`subfuzzer -domain example.com -wordlist subdomains.txt -threads 10`
